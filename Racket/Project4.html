    <h1>CIS 505/705, (Introduction to) Programming Languages, Fall 2019.</h1>
<h2>Project #4 (25 points). Due on Monday, November 18, 2019, 8am</h2>

Use <em><a href="http://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/">Racket</a></em> to write an interpreter for the object-oriented functional language described in the text below.
<p>
The main techniques for doing so 
<ul>
<li>
are mentioned in the slides <tt>MutationsInterpret</tt> (uploaded
on Canvas), and 
<li>
are also mentioned in
<a href="http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs173/2012/book/mut-struct-vs-var.html">Chapter 8</a> (in particular Section 8.1) of the textbook.
</ul>
The expected benefits are that you will understand how 
the judicious use of environments and stores 
makes it possible 
to model a language that allows
statically scoped functions as well as mutable objects.

<h3>Language Syntax</h3>
<em>Expressions</em> are given by the syntax
<pre>
exp ::= id
     |  num
     |  "lambda" id exp0
     |  "apply" exp1 exp2
     |  "let" id exp1 exp0
     |  "let" "_" exp1 exp2
     |  "cond" exp0 exp1 exp2
     |  op exp1 exp2
     |  "letclass" id fields ":" exp0 
     |  "new" id
     |  "get" id exp1
     |  "set" id exp1 exp2

fields ::= id
        |  id fields

 op ::= "+"
     |  "-"
     |  "*"

</pre>
That is, an expression can be 
<ul>
<li>
an identifier (a sequence
of one or more letters or digits that does not form a keyword
and where the first element is a letter)
<li>
a non-negative integer (a sequence of digits)
<li>
a function definition
<li>
a function application 
<li>
a local definition <tt>let</tt> <i>x</i> <i>e1</i> <i>e0</i> 
which evaluates <i>e1</i>, stores the result 
in a new location denoted by <i>x</i>, and then 
evaluates <i>e0</i>
<li>
a sequential composition <tt>let</tt> <i>_</i> <i>e1</i> <i>e2</i> 
which evaluates <i>e1</i> but only for its effect 
on the store (not for its value),
and then evaluates <i>e2</i>
<li>
a conditional (positive integers are considered <tt>true</tt>, all other values
are considered <tt>false</tt>)
<li>
an application of an arithmetic operator, using prefix notation
(as in Project #3)
<li>
a local class definition 
<tt>letclass</tt> <i>C</i> <i>f1,f2... fn</i> <tt>:</tt> <i>e0</i>
(with <i>n</i> &gt; 0)
where inside <i>e0</i> it is possible to refer to <i>C</i>
so as to create objects with fields <i>f1,f2..fn</i>
<li>
an object creation <tt>new</tt> <i>C</i>
that creates a fresh object with field names given by
the definition of <i>C</i>
<li>
a field reference <tt>get</tt> <i>f e1</i> 
that retrieves the value
of field <i>f</i> in the object that <i>e1</i> evaluates to
<li>
a field update <tt>set</tt> <i>f e1 e2</i> that
in the object that <i>e1</i> evaluates to
sets the field <i>f</i> to the value of <i>e2</i>.
</ul>

<h3>Language Semantics</h3>
As described in the background material (and as done in Project #2), 
we shall use <em>locations</em>
to &quot;mediate&quot; between identifiers and values;
for that purpose, we employ
<ul>
<li>
<em>environments</em> that binds identifiers
(introduced by <tt>let</tt> or <tt>lambda</tt>), and also fields, to locations
<li>
<em>class environments</em> that binds identifiers
introduced by <tt>letclass</tt> to lists of field names
<li>
<em>stores</em> that binds locations to values (there is no default value;
it is an error to access a location which has not yet been given a value).
</ul>
Expressions are evaluated (using call-by-value) as follows:
<ul>
<li>
given an environment, a class environement, and a store
<li>
evaluation returns a value, <em>and</em> a potentially updated store.
</ul>
There are 3 kinds of <em>values</em>:
<ul>
<li>
integers (the program must ultimately return a such)
<li>
function closures (as in Project #3,
so as to implement static scope)
<li>
objects (represented as &quot;local&quot; 
environments that bind field names to locations).
</ul>

<h3>Examples</h3>
We can do simple arithmetic and conditionals:
<pre>
  (run "* + 8 4 - 5 1")
</pre>
should return 48.
<pre>
  (run "cond - 9 8 
          cond - 7 7
            1 
            cond - 5 6
              2 
              cond lambda w w 
                3 
                4 
          5")
</pre>
should return 4 (since the only true values are the positive integers).
<p>
We can (as in Project #3) define and use (higher-order) functions:
<pre>
  (run "apply
          lambda w * w w
          7")
</pre>
should return 49,
<pre>
  (run "let z 7 
        * 8 z")
</pre>
should return 56, and
<pre>
  (run "let twice lambda g lambda x apply g apply g x
        let addfour lambda z + z 4
          apply apply twice addfour 2")
</pre>
should return 10.
<p>
We can create objects, write their fields, and subsequently read those fields:
<pre>
  (run "letclass C a :
        let x new C
        let y new C
        let _ set a x 33 
        let _ set a y 44
      + get a x 
        get a y")
</pre>
should return 77
(which confirms that the the <tt>a</tt> field in <tt>x</tt>
differs from the <tt>a</tt> field in <tt>y</tt>). 
<p>
As on the slides, we can define counters; in the proper way:
<pre>
 (run "letclass Counter count :
        let loc new Counter
        let _ set count loc 0
        let fresh 
           lambda void 
             let _ set count loc 
                       + 1 get count loc
             get count loc
      + apply fresh 37 
        apply fresh 37")
</pre>
which should return 1 + 2 = 3, and in a flawed way:
<pre>
  (run "letclass Counter count :
        let fresh 
           lambda void
             let loc new Counter
             let _ set count loc 0 
             let _ set count loc 
                       + 1 get count loc 
             get count loc
        + apply fresh 37 
          apply fresh 37")
</pre>
which should return 1 + 1 = 2.
<p>
We can create objects with more than one field:
<pre>
  (run "letclass AB a b :
        let w new AB
        let _ set b w 22 
        let _ set a w 66
       + get a w 
         get b w")
</pre>
should return 88.
<p>
We can check that evaluation is left-to-right:
<pre>
  (run "letclass A a :
        let z new A 
        let _ set a z 1
         + let _ set a z 5
              get a z
           let _ set a z 
                     + get a z 2
              apply lambda y * y 3 
                    get a z")
</pre>
should return 5 + 7 x 3 = 26
(but if evaluation was right-to-left it would return
5 + 3 x 3 = 14).
<p>
Fields can be bound to functions (methods):
<pre>
  (run "letclass N n add :
        let w new N
        let _ set n w 7
        let _ set add w 
                  lambda x set n w 
                               + x get n w
        let _ apply get add w 4 
        let _ apply get add w 5
         get n w")
</pre>
should return 16
(since <tt>add</tt> is bound to a method that given <i>x</i>
increases the <tt>n</tt> field by <i>x</i>).
<p>

<h3>Functionality of Interpreter</h3>
You must write a Racket program,
using the skeleton provided (which includes a parser)
that evaluates programs in the given language.
<p>
Your program should be such that if you put it in a file <tt>ObjFun.rkt</tt>,
in the top area of DrRacket type
<pre>
#lang racket
(require "ObjFun.rkt")
</pre>
 and in the bottom area type
<pre>
  (run "&lt;text of program&gt;")
</pre>
then the value of that program will be output. 
<p>

<h4>Error Messages</h3>
Your interpreter should give suitable error messages.
Some of the possible semantic errors are to access 
the field of a non-object
as in &quot;<tt>get a 0</tt>&quot;,
or to <tt>get</tt> a field that has not yet been <tt>set</tt>,
but there are several more!
<p>
As long as your interpreter reports a given error, you are <em>not</em> 
required to ensure that it then terminates properly without further error messages.
<p>
<h3>Submission</h3>
You must do this exercise on your own.
<p>
Submit to Canvas 
<em>one</em> file which should contain your Racket interpreter.
<p>
Do <em>not</em> 
expect the instructor or the TAs to answer any questions after Friday, November 15, at 4pm.
<p>
<b>Important</b>:
It is certainly OK to discuss the assignment with 
the instructor, TAs, or your fellow students, 
but all the coding must be typed by you,
and all the concepts in the coding must be stored in your head so that 
you can reproduce them on demand.
